Here's a basic outline of how to create a simple snake game in Java:

    Set up the game window: First, you need to set up a window for the game.
    You can do this using Java's built-in Swing library. You will also need to set up 
    a timer to update the game state and repaint the screen at a fixed interval.

    Define the Snake: You will need to define the Snake class, which will represent 
    the snake in the game. The Snake class will need to keep track of the snake's position 
    and direction. You will also need to implement a method to update the snake's
    position and direction based on user input.

    Define the Food: You will also need to define the Food class, which will represent the food 
    that the snake needs to eat to grow. The Food class will need to have a random position
    and be placed on the screen at the start of the game.

    Collision detection: You will need to implement collision detection between the snake 
    and the food, as well as between the snake and the edges of the screen.

    Game Over: If the snake collides with the edge of the screen or with its own body, the game should be over.

    Score: You can keep track of the player's score by counting how many pieces of food the snake has eaten.
